# W8 TodoList
The application allows a user to create new tasks,
assign them a title and due date, 
and choose a project for that task to belong to. 
It uses a text based user interface via the command-line. 
Once they are using the application,
the user will be able to also edit, mark as done or remove tasks. 
They can also quit and save
the current task list to file, and then restart the application with the former state restored. 

Requirements

- Model a task with a task title, due date, status and project
- Display a collection of tasks that can be sorted both by date and project
- Support the ability to add, edit, mark as done, and remove tasks
- Support a text-based user interface
- Load and save task list to file The solution may also include other creative features at your discretion in case you wish to show some flair. 

Created class Task with an ID to make it easier to update and delete task by Id.

- It is generated after Add() only and can not be changed.
- ProjName is created on Add() as well and can not be changed.
  
I would like to have created functions to create, edit and delete class Project but didn't have enough time.

I would like to have created a more Object Oriented approach but it is early days, I hope to get better at it in a near future.

Working with Text files is no fun.

Please let start using databases :)
